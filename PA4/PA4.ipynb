Pretrained models, also known as foundation models, capture a diverse range of features that are useful for many vision tasks, and fine-tuning these models requires less computational resources and data compared to training a network from scratch.\n",

    "- You should import a pretrained [VGG11]((https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.vgg11.html).) model from torchvision.\n",

    "- To adapt the pretrained VGG11 model for CIFAR10, which has 10 classes, a common strategy is to freeze the backbone and train a new classifier head. \n",
    "- The Backbone refers to the convolutional base of the VGG11 model responsible for feature extraction.\n",
    "- Freezing involves setting the parameters of the backbone layers so that their values do not change during training (for example, by setting `requires_grad=False` on these parameters).\n",
    "- This approach leverages the already learned features from ImageNet, reducing the training time and required amount of CIFAR10 data.\n",
    "- After freezing the backbone, the final classification layer (or head) is replaced or modified to suit the CIFAR10 classification task.\n",
    "- The new classifier head is initialized with random weights and is trained on CIFAR10 data.\n",
    "- Only the parameters of this new head are updated during training, which helps in adapting the modelâ€™s predictions to the specifics of CIFAR10.\n",
    "- Finally, you should evaluate the accuracy of your pretrained model on CIFAR-10 and compare it with when you trained the model from scratch in the previous part. Also comment briefly on the training time/compute required for both of the tasks."
