    "## Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model is based on **Bayes' Theorem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y \\mid x) = \\frac{P(x \\mid y)P(y)}{P(x)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What we really want is to find the class \\(c\\) that maximizes \\(P(c \\mid x)\\), so we can use the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{c} = \\underset{c}{\\text{argmax}} \\ P(c \\mid x) = \\underset{c}{\\text{argmax}} \\ P(x \\mid c)P(c)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**, we assume that each word \\(x_i\\) in a sentence follows a **Bernoulli distribution**, meaning that the word either appears (1) or does not appear (0) in the document. We can simplify the formula using this assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{c} = \\underset{c}{\\text{argmax}} \\ P(c) \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i = 1 \\mid c)^{x_i} P(x_i = 0 \\mid c)^{1 - x_i}\n",

    "- $x_i = 1$ if the $i^{\\text{th}}$ word is present in the document.\n",
    "- $x_i = 0$ if the $i^{\\text{th}}$ word is not present in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate $P(c)$ by counting the number of times each class appears in our training data, and dividing by the total number of training examples. We can estimate $P(x_i = 1 \\mid c)$ by counting the number of documents in class $c$ that contain the word $x_i$, and dividing by the total number of documents in class $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Important: Laplace Smoothing**\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating $P(x_i = 1 \\mid c)$ and $P(x_i = 0 \\mid c)$, we apply **Laplace smoothing** to avoid zero probabilities. This is essential because, without it, any word that has not appeared in a document of class $c$ will have a probability of zero, which would make the overall product zero, leading to incorrect classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: Laplace smoothing ensures that we don't encounter zero probabilities by adding a small constant (typically 1) to both the numerator and the denominator. This is particularly useful when a word has never appeared in the training data for a specific class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smoothed probability formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x_i = 1 \\mid c) = \\frac{\\text{count of documents in class } c \\text{ where } x_i = 1 + 1}{\\text{total documents in class } c + 2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures no word has a zero probability, even if it was unseen in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoiding Underflow with Logarithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid underflow errors due to multiplying small probabilities, we apply logarithms, which convert the product into a sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{c} = \\underset{c}{\\text{argmax}} \\ \\log P(c) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ x_i \\log P(x_i = 1 \\mid c) + (1 - x_i) \\log P(x_i = 0 \\mid c) \\right]\n",
